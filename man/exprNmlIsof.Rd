\title{Human Breast Cancer RNA-sequencing data from TCGA - Adj. Normal Tissue}
\description{
These RNA-sequencing expression data were obtained from the Cancer Genome
Atlas project (now the Genomic Data Commons (GDC)). The sequencing data were
generated from adjacent normal breast tissue data from 113 patients with
breast cancer. Quantification of RNA expression values was performed using
standard GDC pipelines. The expression values are reported in transcripts per
million reads. Out of an initial 73,599 RNA transcripts, 700 are included as
part of this dataset. These 700 transcripts represent a random subset of the
transcripts with at least 20% non-zero expression values across all patient
samples. Rows contain anonymized patient identifiers, while columns contain
UCSC gene symbols.
